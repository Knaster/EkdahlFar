This is the firmware for The KNAS Ekdahl FAR

Please be adviced that this code is under development and requires some hefty cleanup, it is quite ugly at points.

The code has been developed using Code::Blocks 20.03 and a project file is included in the source.
As development of Code::Blocks seems to have stopped i am looking to migrate this project to a different
project manager / IDE at some point.

To use this code you either need a Ekdahl FAR, which unless you broke into my house and stole one, you do not have.
You can however upload the code into a free-standing Teensy 4.0, you will most likely get a lot of error messages
when running but you should still be able to test out the general system either by serial commands or by using the
Configuration Software.

This software should be considered to be in near-release Beta stage
